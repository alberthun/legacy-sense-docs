Device data needs to be mapped to fields by their data types. This allows you to trigger specific rules on those values and generate analytics. 
This mapping is done using Schemas. Mobile devices (iOS, Android) have predefined schemas that you can use with our SDK and you donâ€™t need to configure them.

For IoT devices you need to first create a custom schema. You can send any kind of data with IoT devices.
It is recommended that you generate IoT schema based on your event payload. 
Once your schema is defined you can use it in a Channel and see data being ingested. 
You can update a schema if necessary at a later time. Once you create a schema for your data, you can assign it to your IoT channel.

## Creating a Schema

To create a schema through the dashboard
1. Go to **Channels**
2. In the left sidebar under Schemas, click **+ Add Schema**

3. **Name & Details** - Enter a name for the schema in "Name" field
4. **Define Fields** - Use this section to specify the format of your schema


Here is a simple example:
To define a schema for a JSON payload such as
```json
 "data":{
      "tempF":52,
      "humidity":23
    }
```
add each attribute individually under the **Define Fields** section.

- Click **Add new attribute**  
- In the **Attribute Location** drop-down, ensure that "root" is selected
- In the **Attribute Identifier** field, enter "data"
- In the **Data Type** drop-down, select "Object"
- Click **Create Attribute** 
Next, add the second attribute named "tempF" the same way:  
- Click **Add new attribute**
- In the **Attribute Location** drop-down, select "data"
- In the **Attribute Identifier** field, enter "tempF"
- In the **Data Type** drop-down, select "Integer"
- Click **Create Attribute**

Add the final attribute named "humidity" in a similar manner. 

5. When finished, click **Create Schema**  Your schema should look like the following:

To create a schema using the API:

##### POST /v2/schemas

Fields:
* name - the name of this schema
* format - "json" for a JSON formatted data
* fields - the object representation of the structure of your data. Supports multiple levels of nested fields.
	* id - the name of your attribute
	* type - the type of attribute: 'object', 'string', 'float', 'integer', 'timestamp', 'datetime'
```json
{
	"name": "my schema",
	"format": "json",
	"fields": [{
		"id": "data",
		"type": "object",
		"fields": [{
			"id": "humidity",
			"type": "integer"
		}, {
			"id": "tempF",
			"type": "integer"
		}]
	}]
}
```
`Code: 201`
```json
{
	"data": {
		"id": "01CMDMCSF92P5ZSHKE119R9BTE",
		"name": "test 3",
		"format": "json",
		"organizationId": "01C54H1MTA8K8ZZ0B7WNB3P0N6",
		"fields": [{
			"id": "data",
			"type": "object",
			"fields": [{
					"id": "humidity",
					"type": "integer"
				},
				{
					"id": "tempF",
					"type": "integer"
				}
			]
		}],
		"createdAt": "2018-08-08T20:42:03Z",
		"updatedAt": "2018-08-08T20:42:03Z"
	}
}
```


## Assigning a Schema

Once you are satisfied with your schema, you can assign it to an IoT channel which you can then use to connect your devices.

1. Go to Channels
2. In the left sidebar, click **+ Add Channel**
3. Select IoT Devices
4. Enter a name for your channel, then select your **Schema** in the drop-down
5. Click Create

Your schema is now assigned to this channel. *Note: at this time that you cannot change a schema that a channel is assigned to. You will need to create a new channel.*
