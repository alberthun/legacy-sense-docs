title: Channels Overview
description: "Using Channels in Sense"
---

A data channel is a source of data that is connected to the Sense platform. For example, a channel could include iOS devices running a Reach-enabled app. Channels are collections of mobile devices enabled with the Reach SDK, or other devices that connect to the Sense Ingress API or Reach Edge agent (gateway).

Channels are created based on the type of device that will connect to it. A channel can be of type iOS, Android, or IoT. Each channel uses its own API key for authentication.

## Creating a Channel

1.  In the dashboard, go to Channels. If this is your organization's first channel, you will be presented with an Intro screen. Click **Add New Channel**

    -  Select **IoT Devices** to create a channel for generic IoT data that will be sent using the Sense Ingress API
3.  Enter a name for your channel. Channel names must be unique to your account.
