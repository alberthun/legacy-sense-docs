---

Developers can connect mobile devices to the Sense platform easily using the Reach SDK. Device sensor data is pulled into Sense through the Ingress API. For mobile devices, this can be done by integrating the Reach SDK into a mobile app. The SDK handles sensor gathering (GPS, WiFi, beacons, activity and motion, etc) at configurable intervals, and automatically sends the data to the Ingress API. The SDKs are authenticated using the API keys for their respective channels.

The SDK is available for both [iOS](/guides/sdks/ios) and [Android](/guides/sdks/android).
