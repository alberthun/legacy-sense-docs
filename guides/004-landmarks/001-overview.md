Landmarks are geographical points of interest (POIs) defined by a perimeter. Landmarks can be used as conditions to rules that evaluate a device's proximity to an area. A rule may check if a device has entered, exited, is inside, or outside the landmark. The Landmark API provides several options for defining landmarks.


Landmarks can be added within the **Add New Rule** or through the Landmarks section.
