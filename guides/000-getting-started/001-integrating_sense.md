## Integration Methods

There are a few ways to integrate with the Sense platform:

### API

Use our [APIs](/apis) to access the core features of the platform.

### SDKs

Use the [Reach SDKs](/guides/sdks/overview) to integrate Sense into your Android or iOS app to enable sensor data collection capabilities.

### Sense Edge

The [Edge Agent](/guides/sense-edge) is able to process data on a device without a persistent connection to the platform.
