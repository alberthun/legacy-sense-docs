------------------

Device sensor data is ingested into Sense 2.0 through the [Ingress API](http://docs.sixgill.com/ingress-api.html). For Android and iOS devices, this can be done by integrating the Sense SDK into a mobile app. The SDK handles sensor gathering at configurable intervals, and automatically sends the data to the Ingress API. The SDKs are authenticated using the API keys for the channel.
