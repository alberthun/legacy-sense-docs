title: Indoor Positioning in Reach
description: "Using Indoor Positioning capabilities"
---

Reach provides indoor positioning capabilities as part of the the SDK by partnering with experienced indoor navigation providers such as [IndoorAtlas](https://www.indooratlas.com/) and [Phunware](http://phunware.com/).

Indoor positioning requires beaconing, preparing the indoor venue, configuring beacons, and fingerprinting the space. A signed POC for indoor positioning is required to advise or assist clients in completing these tasks.
