description: "Using Channels in Sense"
---

A data channel is a source of data that flows into the Sense platform. For example, a channel could include all iOS devices with an app that uses the Sense Reach iOS SDK. Channels are collections of mobile apps that use the Sense SDKs, or of any other devices that write to the Sense Ingress API.

Channels are created based on the type of device that will connect to it. A channel can be of type iOS, Android, or IoT.

See [Channels](/guides/getting-started#creating-a-channel) section of the Getting Started Guide for information on creating a channel through the dashboard.

See the [Channels API docs](apis/sense-api#/Channels) for managing channels through the API.
